# MATH 2820L Final Project Proposal

**Title of Project:** Diabetes Data-Diving

**Name of Group Members:** Nilai Vemula, Sithara Samudrala, Anvitha Kosaraju

## Data

The data we are analyzing was collected using direct questionnaires from patients from the Sylhet Diabetes Hospital that were located in Sylhet, Bangladesh. All of the answers from this questionnaire were approved by a doctor. Our data contains categorical information, regarding several facets of diabetes and age.

## Problem Statement

Through this project, we want to understand these possible and common risk factors that are tied to diabetes and to understand any patterns that occur between having diabetes and presence of risk factors such as old age, obesity, polyuria, polydipsia, and other factors mentioned within the dataset. This would be useful to someone because it can provide useful information for individuals that want to learn more about diabetes. In addition, this can also provide information to individuals that might experience a good number of these risk factors, and see whether or not he or she should seek a medical professional for a diabetes diagnosis.

## Goals

Our goal is to understand the diabetes data set and then use exploratory data analysis to identify how common some of the risk factors are. Then, we can investigate correlations between the variables. Our next goal is to build a predictive model for diabetes. This model would be a binary classifier, and we can experiment by using a logistic regression. We chose this type of model because there are two possible outcomes of the response variable (class) in the dataset. Additionally, the predictor values are all categorical with two possible values with the exception of age. We would guess that increased age and the presence of obesity would make a patient more likely to have diabetes. Finally, we can combine the most important factors to develop a “Diabetes Risk Score,” and we would use this score to identify individuals that would be at highest risk for diabetes.
